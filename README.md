# Chainlink-hackathon

- Added Hardhat and OpenZeppelin dependencies
- Added a boilerplate for TicketFactory (extends ERC1155 which from conducted research seems to be the goto standard for our application)
- My suggestion is that we keep this branch for main upgrades, so any change to the repo should be implemented on its own branch. Proposals for merge can be done through Pull requests
